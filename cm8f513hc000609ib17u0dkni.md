## How do we limit the environmental impact of Generative AI?

What if AI queries could be not only smarter, but also greener?

These questions ignited an inspiring journey at [Ontario Tech University’s 2025 HackHive](https://hackhive-otu.devpost.com/) hackathon, forever reshaping my career path and deepening my commitment to sustainable technology.

In just 36 hours of intense collaboration, fuelled by enthusiasm and caffeine galore, what began as a small idea — sparked by the hackathon’s theme “AI for a Better Tomorrow” — quickly evolved into something transformative.

Alongside my exceptional teammates, [Juliana Losada Prieto](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliana-losada-prieto/), [Tomasz Puzio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tomasz-puzio/), and [Klein Cafa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cafakleinn/), we tackled one of technology’s most pressing yet frequently overlooked issues: the significant environmental impact of generative AI models. Powerful and revolutionary, these AI interactions consume immense computational resources, leaving behind substantial carbon footprints. We believed a smarter, greener alternative was possible.

## Introducing SUSTAIN: A Greener Approach to AI

Our solution, SUSTAIN, is an eco-friendly AI wrapper designed to intelligently optimize token usage. By filtering out non-essential words from prompts and refining outputs from large language models (LLMs), SUSTAIN significantly reduces computational demands, directly translating into measurable environmental benefits.

Our initial prototype — a modest Tkinter application developed under the pressures and constraints of a hackathon — earned us 5th place among 82 competitive teams. This early success was more than validation; it ignited our passion and highlighted the vast potential of our concept.

Driven by this momentum, we quickly scaled our prototype into a fully functional web application hosted on Microsoft Azure. Our ambition continued to grow as we initiated parallel development for iOS and Android platforms, committed to making sustainable AI accessible to a global audience.

### Capturing Industry Attention

Our dedication soon caught the attention of industry leaders. A pivotal moment came when [Krishna Venkataraman](https://www.linkedin.com/in/krishnavenk/), Azure Specialist and HackHive judge, recognized the broader potential of SUSTAIN and invited us to present at the esteemed [2025 Global AI Bootcamp](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/reactor/events/24488/) at Microsoft Canada’s headquarters in Toronto. This platform connected us to a vibrant community of innovators dedicated to responsible technology, significantly broadening our vision and networks.

The momentum accelerated further during a subsequent internship interview, where my experiences with AI sustainability led to a compelling live demonstration of SUSTAIN. The discussion rapidly evolved from a typical interview into a profound conversation on technology’s societal responsibilities. Not only did this interaction secure my internship — it reinforced my conviction that technology, thoughtfully applied, holds immense power for positive change.

## Our Journey Continues

Throughout developing SUSTAIN, I’ve acquired much more than technical proficiency in coding, API integration, natural language processing, and Agile methodologies. I’ve evolved as a collaborator, public speaker, and advocate for sustainable innovation. Most significantly, I’ve become part of an inspiring community of technologists, mentors, and leaders who are committed to harnessing technology for good.

Today, SUSTAIN is live in alpha at [sustainai.ca](http://sustainai.ca), continually shaped by user feedback and ongoing research. Our resolve to make AI greener, smarter, and universally accessible remains stronger than ever.

I’m deeply grateful to my teammates, mentors, judges, and the Ontario Tech University community. Together, we’ve transformed a weekend hackathon idea into a meaningful real-world innovation, demonstrating that technology is not merely about invention — it’s about creating a sustainable future, one optimized token at a time.
